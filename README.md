# Fun C Projects
![Visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=Impactabdou.c_project)

During the summer of **2025**, I had a lot of free time—so I decided to spend it in the best way possible: **building fun projects in C**.  
This repo is a collection of those projects, where I explored game development, networking, and low-level system programming.

## Flappy Bird (Terminal Edition)

A terminal-based implementation of the **classic Flappy Bird game**—the bird flies, pipes appear, and gravity does its thing.  

### Features  
- Playable directly in the terminal  
- Simple controls, nostalgic gameplay  

### Future Improvements  
- Add socket support for multiplayer racing (two players competing simultaneously)  
- Stream the game state to another device in real-time

## HTTP Web Server

A lightweight **HTTP server** built entirely from scratch in C. This was my way of learning about **Unix sockets** and the **HTTP protocol** at a deeper level.  

### Features (so far)  
- Supports GET, POST, and PUT requests  
- Parses HTTP headers  
- Handles error codes gracefully  

### Future Improvements  
- Add header inspection/logging for better debugging  
- Expand protocol support (keep-alive, chunked transfer, etc.)
